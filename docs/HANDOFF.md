# Handoff — state of work and next steps (2026-10-05)

## Where things stand
- Migrated from the `jack-app` repository into this standalone repository; no dependency on the
  US-equity codebase remains (generic utilities live in `btc_swing/core`).
- Phase 1 (foundation) and Phase 2 (eight setup families, PIT auxiliary features, mark-price
  liquidation, forward labels, null benchmark, leverage comparison, first validation) are done.
- Validation with FROZEN pre-registered defaults, 2022-01..2023-12 development and 2024
  chronological validation: `reports/BTC_SWING_V1_PHASE2_VALIDATION.md`. Verdict: repeatable positive
  expectancy NOT demonstrated (combined +0.08R net, t=0.9; 2022-23 +0.13R, 2024 +0.01R; costs take
  ~64% of the gross edge; never-triggered plans out-ran traded ones). Result hash
  `92ebe5d7fc65...` (see `manifests/phase2_validation_run_manifest.json`).
- Phase 3 has NOT started. The next step is the owner's decision on the single pre-registered
  structural hypothesis proposed in report §21. No tuning.

## Commands
```
uv sync --all-extras
export BTC_DATA_DIR=./data
uv run btc-swing data ingest --from 2021-10 --to 2024-12   # ~1.5k archive files, resumable
uv run btc-swing backtest --from 2024-01-01 --to 2025-01-01 --verify-determinism --out data/btc/runs/smoke
uv run btc-swing phase2 --out data/btc/runs/phase2_validation
bash scripts/check.sh
```

## Known data facts
- Two venue incidents where 5m archive bars are stale vs native hourly bars: 2023-11-10
  15:00–17:00 UTC and 2024-10-28 20:00–21:00 UTC. Daily bars match exactly.
- Mark-price and premium-index klines have a few missing days (2022-10, 2023-02); the engine falls
  back to traded extremes for liquidation where a mark bar is missing.
- Early `metrics` files (2021) contain empty fields; parsed as nulls.
